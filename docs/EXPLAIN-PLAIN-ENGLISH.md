# Plain-English Architecture & Implementation Guide

This guide explains each part of the **Multi-Agent Supply Chain Decision System** in plain English. For each task and architectural component, it provides:
1. A real-world analogy
2. How the code works in simple terms
3. A 3-sentence interview answer

## T0: Project Setup and Contracts

### Real-World Analogy
Before breaking ground on a skyscraper, architects and engineers lay out the blueprints, zoning regulations, building codes, and safety contracts. T0 establishes the strict contractual scope (`SPEC.md`), task plan (`TASKS.md`), and agent rules (`AGENTS.md`) before any line of functional code is written.

### How the Code Works
We initialized the Git repository with strict LF line endings, `.gitignore` preventing data/secret leaks, and pushed the base scope contract to GitHub (`adwitiya-pandey/multi-agent-supply-chain-system`). This guarantees reproducible development in a clean Linux/WSL2 environment.

### 3-Sentence Interview Answer
I set up the repository foundation with exhaustive specification and task contracts defining a 5-agent sequential supply-chain system. The contract specifies deterministic mathematics owning all inventory numbers and an external human-in-the-loop approval gate. This architecture ensures safety, zero hallucinations in purchase orders, and complete auditability from day zero.

## T1: Project Scaffolding and SDK Verification

### Real-World Analogy
Before a flight crew boards a commercial airliner, maintenance engineers inspect the instruments, calibrate fuel gauges, and verify flight control sensors against manufacturer specifications. T1 builds the empty skeleton of the software aircraft and runs live probes against the CrewAI and Pydantic libraries to guarantee every underlying API behaves as documented.

### How the Code Works
Using Python 3.13 and `uv`, we created the modular package structure under `src/supplychain/` with all 21 modules stubbed out with docstrings. We set up GitHub Actions CI with Ruff linting/formatting and Pytest coverage, configured `.env.example` with zero secrets, and executed the SDK probe script verifying that offline ReAct tool calling, token tracking, and callback error propagation function properly in CrewAI 1.15.28.

### 3-Sentence Interview Answer
I scaffolded the project structure, dependency constraints, and GitHub Actions CI pipeline using Python 3.13 and uv. I verified the CrewAI 1.15 SDK behavior using an offline probe that proved ReAct fallback, token tracking, and task callback lifecycle without making external API calls. This confirmed all framework assumptions prior to implementing core business logic.
